<p>General Charles Scott played an active role in the establishment of
the United States foothold in the Northwest Territory. He participated in
General Josiah Harmar&rsquo;s ill-fated expedition in 1790, in the campaign of
General Arthur St. Clair in 1791, and also in General Anthony Wayne&rsquo;s
triumph at Fallen Timbers in 1794.</p>
<p>While St. Clair was preparing his army in 1791, he sent Scott, with
about eight hundred Kentucky volunteers, into the Wabash region around the
Indian town of Ouiatenon to distract the attention of the Indians. That Scott
was more successful than his commander was destined to be is shown in
his report to the Secretary of War, printed later as a letter in the INDIANAPOLIS
GAZETTE. It is reprinted here with changes in grammar, spelling,
and punctuation.</p>

<p class="tb">Sir:</p>
<p>In prosecution of the enterprise, I marched (with eight hundred and
fifty troops under my command) four miles from the banks of the Ohio on
May 23. On the twenty-fourth, I resumed my march and pushed forward
with the utmost industry. I directed my route to Ouiatenon in the best
manner my guides and information enabled me, though both were greatly
deficient.</p>
<p>By May 31, I had marched one hundred and fifty miles over a country
cut by four large branches of the White River and by many smaller streams
with steep, muddy banks. During this march, I crossed country alternately
interspersed with the most luxurious soil and with deep clay bogs from one
to five miles wide, which were rendered almost impassable by brush and
briers. Rain fell in torrents every day, with frequent blasts of wind and
thunderstorms. These obstacles impeded my progress, wore down my
horses, and destroyed my provisions.</p>
<p>On the morning of June 1, as the army entered an extensive prairie,
I saw an Indian on horseback a few miles to the right. I immediately sent
a detachment to intercept him, but he escaped. Finding myself discovered,
I determined to advance with all the rapidity my circumstances would permit,
rather with the hope than with the expectation of reaching the object
sought that day, for my guides were strangers to the country which I occupied.
At one o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, having marched by computation one
hundred and fifty-five miles from the Ohio, I entered a grove which bordered
on an extensive prairie and discovered two small villages to my left,
two and four miles distant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="600" height="717" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>My guides now recognized the ground and informed me that the main
town was four or five miles in front, behind a point of woods which jutted
into the prairie. I immediately detached Colonel John Hardin, with sixty
mounted infantrymen and a troop of light horse under Captain McCoy, to
attack the villages to the left, while I moved on briskly with my main body,
in order of battle, toward the town, the smoke of which was discernible.
My guides were mistaken concerning the location of the town; instead of its
standing at the edge of the plain through which I had marched, I found, in
the low ground bordering on the Wabash (on turning the point of woods),
just one house in front of me. Captain Price was ordered to assault that
with forty men. He executed the command with great gallantry and killed
two warriors.</p>
<p>When I gained the summit of the hill which overlooks the villages on
the banks of the Wabash, I discovered the enemy, in great confusion, endeavoring
to make their escape over the river in canoes. I instantly ordered
Lieutenant Colonel Commandant Wilkinson to rush forward with the
first battalion. This detachment gained the bank of the river just as the
rear of the enemy embarked. Regardless of a brisk fire kept up from a
Kickapoo town on the opposite bank, well-directed rifle fire destroyed in a
few minutes all the savages crowded in five canoes.</p>
<p>The enemy still kept possession of the Kickapoo town. I determined
to dislodge them; for that purpose I ordered Captain King&rsquo;s and Captain
Logsdon&rsquo;s companies, under the direction of Major Barbee, to march down
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
and to cross the river below the town. Several of the men swam the river,
and others traveled in a small canoe. This movement was unobserved; my
men had taken posts on the bank before they were discovered by the enemy,
who immediately abandoned the village. About this time, word was brought
me that Colonel Hardin was encumbered with prisoners and that he had discovered
a stronger village (farther to my left than those I had observed),
which he was proceeding to attack. I immediately detached Captain Brown
with his company to support the colonel; but, as the distance was six miles,
before the captain arrived the business was done. Colonel Hardin joined
me a little before sunset, having killed six warriors and having taken fifty-two
prisoners. Captain Bull, the warrior who discovered me in the morning,
had gained the main town and had given the alarm; but the Indians of
the villages to the left were uninformed of my approach and had no chance
to retreat. The next morning, I decided to detach my lieutenant colonel
commandant, with five hundred men, to destroy the important town of Kenapacomaqua
at the mouth of the Eel River, eighteen [sic] miles from my
camp and on the west side of the Wabash. But, on examination, I discovered
that my men and horses were so crippled and worn down by the long,
laborious march and the active exertion of the preceding day that only three
hundred and sixty men could be found able to undertake the enterprise; they
prepared to march on foot.</p>
<p>Colonel Wilkinson marched with this detachment at 5:30 p.m. and,
returning to my camp the next day at 1:00 p.m., marched this six [sic]
miles in about five hours and destroyed the most important settlements of
the enemy in that quarter of the federal territory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>The following is Colonel Wilkinson&rsquo;s report respecting the enterprise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sir:</p>
<p>The detachment under my command, ordered to attack the village
of Kenapacomaqua, was put in motion at half-past five o&rsquo;clock last evening.
Knowing that our enemy (whose chief dependence is in his ability as
a marksman and his alertness in covering himself behind trees, stumps,
and other impediments to fair sight) would not hazard an action in the night,
I determined to push my march until I approached the vicinity of the villages,
where I knew the country to be flat and open. I gained my point
without a halt twenty minutes before eleven o&rsquo;clock and lay upon my arms
until four o&rsquo;clock in the morning; half an hour later I assaulted the town
from all quarters. The enemy was vigilant, gave way on my approach,
and in canoes crossed Eel Creek, which washes the northeast part of the
town. The creek was not fordable. My corps dashed forward with the
impetuosity suitable to volunteers and was saluted by the enemy with a
brisk fire from the opposite side of the creek. Dauntlessly they rushed to
the water&rsquo;s edge; finding the river impassable, they returned a volley which
so galled and disconcerted their antagonists that the fire of the enemy was
without effect. In five minutes, the Indians were driven from their cover
and fled precipitantly. I have three slightly wounded men. At half-past
five, the town was in flames; and at six o&rsquo;clock, I commenced my retreat.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Many of the inhabitants of Kenapacomaqua were French and lived in
a state of civilization. Misunderstanding the object of a white flag (which
appeared on a hill opposite me in the afternoon of the first of June), I liberated
an aged squaw and sent her to inform the savages that if they would
come in and surrender, their towns should be spared and they should receive
good treatment. It was afterwards found that this white flag was not
intended as a signal of parley, but that it was placed there to mark the
burial spot of a person of distinction among the Indians. On the fourth of
June, I determined to discharge sixteen of the weakest and most infirm of
my prisoners with a talk to the Wabash tribes (a copy of which follows).
My motives in this measure were to rid the army of a heavy encumbrance;
to gratify the impulses of humanity; to increase the panic my operation had
produced; and, by distracting the council of the enemy, to favor victims of
government.</p>
<p>On the same day, after having burned the towns and adjacent villages
and having destroyed the growing corn and pulse [legumes], I began my
march for the rapids of the Ohio River. I arrived there on the fourteenth
of June, without the loss of a single man by the enemy, and with only five
wounded; I had killed thirty-two, chiefly warriors of size and figure, and
had taken fifty-eight prisoners.</p>

<hr />
<p>To the various tribes of the Piankashaw, and all the nations of red people
living on the waters of the Wabash River:</p>
<p>The Sovereign Council of the Thirteen United States has long patiently
borne your depredations against white settlements on this side of the great
mountains, in the hope that you would see your error and would correct it
by entering into bonds of amity and lasting peace. Moved by compassion
and pity for your misguided councils, it has not unfrequently addressed you
on this subject, but without effect. At length patience is exhausted, and it
has stretched forth the arm of power against you; its mighty sons and chief
warriors have at length taken up the hatchet; they have penetrated far into
your country to meet your warriors and to punish you for your transgressions.
But you fled before them and declined the battle, leaving your wives
and children to their mercy. They have destroyed your old town, Ouiatenon,
and the neighboring villages; and they have taken many prisoners.
Resting here two days to give you time to collect your strength, they have
proceeded to your town of Kenapacomaqua; but again you have fled before
them, and that great town has been destroyed. After giving you this evidence
of their power, they have stopped their hands because they are as
merciful as strong. Again they indulge the hope that you will come to a
sense of your true interest and determine to make a lasting peace with them
and all their children forever. The United States has not desired to destroy
the red people, although it has the power to do so; but should you decline
this invitation and pursue your unprovoked hostilities, its strength
will again be exerted against you. Your warriors will be slaughtered, your
wives and children will be carried into captivity, and you may be assured
that those who escape the fury of our mighty chiefs shall find no resting
place on this side of the Great Lakes. The warriors of the United States
do not wish to distress or destroy women, children, or old men. Although
policy obliges them to retain some in captivity, yet compassion and humanity
have induced them to set at liberty others, who will deliver you this
talk. Those who are carried off will be left in the care of our great chief
and warrior, General St. Clair, near the mouth of the Miami and opposite
to the Licking River, where they will be treated with humanity and tenderness.
If you wish to recover them, repair to the place by the first day of
July; determine with true hearts to bury the hatchet and to smoke the pipe
of peace. They will then be restored to you, and you may again sit down
in security at your old towns and live in peace and happiness, unmolested
by the people of the United States. They will become your friends and protectors
and will be ready to furnish you with all the necessaries you may
require. But should you foolishly persist in your warfare, the sons of war
will be let loose against you; and the hatchet will never be buried until your
country is desolated and your people humbled to the dust.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
